 This function collects cobblestone blocks by using a pickaxe to mine them. It first checks if the bot has a pickaxe in its inventory, and if not, crafts a wooden pickaxe using available resources. It then equips the pickaxe and uses the exploreUntil function to find cobblestone blocks within a certain distance. If enough cobblestone blocks are found, the function mines 10 of them using the mineBlock function.
