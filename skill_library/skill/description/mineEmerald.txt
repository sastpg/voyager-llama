 This function mines emeralds using a diamond or iron pickaxe. It first checks if the player has a diamond or iron pickaxe in their inventory, and if so, equips it. If neither are found, the function crafts an iron pickaxe and equips it. Then, it explores the area until it finds an emerald ore within a 32-block radius, and mines the block. Finally, the function sends a chat message to the player indicating that one emerald has been mined.
