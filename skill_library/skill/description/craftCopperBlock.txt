This function crafts a copper block by first smelting all raw copper, ensuring there are at least 9 copper ingots. It mines and smelts copper ores if necessary. It checks for a crafting table in the inventory, crafting one if needed. The crafting table is then placed, and a copper block is crafted using it. Finally, the bot announces that a copper block has been crafted.
