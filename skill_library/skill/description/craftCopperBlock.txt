 This function crafts a copper block by first smelting all raw copper, then checking if there are enough copper ingots in the inventory. If not, it mines copper ores and smelts them into copper ingots. If a crafting table is not in the inventory, it crafts one and places it near the bot. Finally, it crafts a copper block using the crafting table.
