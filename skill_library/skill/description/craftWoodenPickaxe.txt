This function crafts a wooden pickaxe in Minecraft by ensuring there are enough resources (planks and sticks) in the bot's inventory. It may also craft additional planks or sticks if needed, and crafts a crafting table if one is not already available. The function then places the crafting table, uses it to craft a wooden pickaxe, and sends a chat message to confirm the action.
