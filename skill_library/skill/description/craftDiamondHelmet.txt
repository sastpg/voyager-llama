This function crafts a diamond helmet for the bot. It first checks if there are enough diamond ingots in the inventory, collects more if necessary, and ensures a crafting table is available. The crafting table is then placed near the bot, and a diamond helmet is crafted using it. Finally, the bot announces that it has crafted a diamond helmet.
