This function crafts an emerald block by first ensuring there are at least 9 emeralds in the inventory. If not, it mines emeralds until there are enough. It then checks if a crafting table is available, crafting one if necessary. The crafting table is placed near the bot, and an emerald block is crafted using the crafting table. Finally, the function sends a chat message indicating that an emerald block has been crafted.
