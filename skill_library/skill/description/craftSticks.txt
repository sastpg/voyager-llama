This function crafts sticks in Minecraft by checking if the player has enough planks. It first determines the required number of planks and checks the inventory for logs and corresponding plank types. If there are insufficient planks, it mines a log and crafts wooden planks before crafting the sticks. The function also sends chat messages to update the progress.
