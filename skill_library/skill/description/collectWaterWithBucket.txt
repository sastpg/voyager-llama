This function collects water using a bucket. It first checks if the player has a bucket in their inventory, crafts one if necessary. Then, it finds a nearby water block, or explores until a water block is discovered within 60 seconds. The bot navigates to the water block, equips the bucket, looks at the water, and activates the item to collect water, finally announcing that the water has been collected.
