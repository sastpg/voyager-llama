This function crafts an amethyst block by first ensuring there are at least 4 amethyst shards in the inventory. If not, it mines amethyst clusters until enough shards are obtained. It then checks for a crafting table in the inventory, crafting one if necessary. The crafting table is placed near the bot, and an amethyst block is crafted using it. Finally, the bot announces that an amethyst block has been crafted.
