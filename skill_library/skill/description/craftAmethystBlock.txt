This function crafts an amethyst block by first ensuring the bot has at least 4 amethyst shards. If not, it mines amethyst clusters. It then checks if a crafting table is available, crafting one if necessary. The crafting table is placed nearby, and an amethyst block is crafted using it. Finally, the bot announces that an amethyst block has been crafted.
