This function smelts all raw copper in the bot's inventory. It first checks if there is a furnace and coal available. If a furnace is missing, it crafts one, and if there's no coal, it mines five coal ores. Then, it places the furnace near the bot and uses the coal to smelt the raw copper. Upon completion, it sends a chat message.
