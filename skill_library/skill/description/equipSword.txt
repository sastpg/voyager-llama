This function equips the best sword in the bot's inventory. It first finds the diamond sword, iron sword, stone sword, and wooden sword in the bot's inventory using the `findInventoryItem` method. If any of these swords are found, the function equips the corresponding sword using the `equip` method and sends a chat message to the bot indicating that the sword has been equipped. If no swords are found in the inventory, the function sends a chat message indicating that no sword could be equipped.
