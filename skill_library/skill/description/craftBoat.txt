This function crafts a boat by ensuring there are at least 5 planks in the inventory, crafting planks if necessary. It also checks for a wooden shovel and crafts one if missing. The function then checks for a crafting table, crafting one if needed, placing it next to the bot, and finally crafting a boat.
