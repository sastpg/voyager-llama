This function smelts five raw iron into iron ingots by checking for a furnace and coal in the inventory. If a furnace is not present, it crafts one, and if no coal is found, it mines five coal ores. It then places the furnace nearby and uses coal as fuel to smelt the raw iron. Finally, it sends a chat message confirming the completion of smelting.
