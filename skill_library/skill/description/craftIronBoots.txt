This function crafts iron boots for the bot by first smelting all raw iron, ensuring at least 4 iron ingots are available. It mines and smelts iron ores if necessary. It checks if a crafting table is present, crafts one if needed, places it near the bot, and finally crafts the iron boots using the crafting table. The bot then announces that it has crafted the iron boots.
