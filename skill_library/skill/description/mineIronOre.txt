This function mines 1 iron ore block using an iron or stone pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available, and if so, equips it. If not, it checks for a stone pickaxe and crafts one if needed. Then, it searches for a single iron ore block within a certain range and mines it. Finally, it sends a chat message confirming the mining of the iron ore.
