This function crafts diamond boots for the bot. It first checks if there are at least 4 diamond ingots in the inventory. If not, it collects diamonds until there are enough. Then, it verifies if a crafting table is available; if not, it crafts one. The crafting table is placed near the bot, and finally, the function crafts diamond boots and announces the action.
