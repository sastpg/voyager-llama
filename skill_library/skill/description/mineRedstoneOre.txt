This function mines a single redstone ore block using an iron pickaxe. If the bot doesn't have an iron pickaxe, it crafts one first, then equips it. It searches for a nearby redstone ore block within a range of 32 blocks and mines it once found. If no redstone ore is found, the bot sends a chat message.
