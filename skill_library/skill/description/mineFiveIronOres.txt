This function mines five iron ore blocks using an iron or stone pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available; if so, it equips it. If not, it attempts to equip a stone pickaxe or crafts one if needed. Then, it searches for at least five iron ore blocks within a certain range. If found, it mines them and sends a chat message confirming the action. If not enough iron ores are found, it sends a different chat message.
