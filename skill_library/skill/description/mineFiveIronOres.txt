This function mines five iron ore blocks using an iron or stone pickaxe. It first checks if an iron pickaxe is available, equips it if found, or crafts and equips a stone pickaxe if not. Then, it searches for at least 5 iron ore blocks within a certain range and mines them. If no iron ores are found, it sends a chat message. After mining, it sends another chat message confirming the action.
