 This function mines an amethyst cluster using a stone or iron pickaxe. It first equips the appropriate pickaxe and then explores the area until it finds an amethyst cluster within a 32-block radius. Once the cluster is found, it mines the block using the "mineBlock" function. Finally, it sends a chat message to the player indicating that one amethyst cluster has been mined.
