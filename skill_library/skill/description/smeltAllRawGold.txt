This function smelts all raw gold in the bot's inventory. It first checks for a furnace and coal. If a furnace is missing, it crafts one, and if there's no coal, it mines five coal ores. Then, it places the furnace near the bot and uses the available coal to smelt the raw gold. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that the raw gold has been smelted.
