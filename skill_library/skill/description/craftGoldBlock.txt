This function crafts a gold block by first smelting all raw gold, checking for enough gold ingots, mining and smelting gold ores if necessary. It then ensures a crafting table is available, crafts one if needed, places it near the bot, and finally crafts the gold block. The process concludes with the bot chatting that a gold block has been crafted.
