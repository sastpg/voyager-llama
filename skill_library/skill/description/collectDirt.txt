 This function collects dirt blocks in Minecraft using the Mineflayer framework. It first checks if the bot has a shovel in its inventory, and if not, crafts a wooden shovel using available resources. The function then equips the shovel and uses the exploreUntil function to find dirt blocks within a 32-block radius. If enough dirt blocks are found, the function mines 10 dirt blocks using the mineBlock function and reports the success in the chat.
