This function crafts a crafting table in Minecraft. It first checks if the player has at least 4 planks in their inventory. If so, it crafts a crafting table. If not, it looks for wooden logs, mines one if none are found, crafts planks from the logs, and then crafts the crafting table. The function communicates the progress to the player via chat messages.
