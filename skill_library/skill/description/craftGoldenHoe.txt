 This function crafts a golden hoe using the Mineflayer framework for Minecraft gameplay. It first smelts all raw gold and checks if there are enough gold ingots and sticks in the inventory. If not, it collects the required items. Then, it checks if a crafting table is in the inventory and crafts one if it is not present. Finally, it places the crafting table near the bot and crafts an golden hoe using the crafting table.
