This function searches for carrots using the exploreUntil function, targeting blocks with a name of "carrots" and an age property of 7 within a 32-block radius. If at least one carrot is found, it navigates the bot to the carrot's location, then digs it up. If no carrots are found, the bot sends a chat message.
