In minecraft, many tasks require long-term planning.
For example, get a set of animal products or cook a variety of meats for a dinner.

I will give you a specific description of the task, and you need to generate a list of plans to complete the task at once.

You must follow the following criteria:
1) Return a Python list of subgoals that can be completed in order to complete the specified task.
2) Each subgoal should follow a concise format like "mine [item_name]" or "craft [item_name]".
3) Your plan list should be as long as possible to get the most done.
4) In the planning list, a subgoal is as detailed as getting an item, and you don't have to think about breaking that item down into a number of pre-steps, which our skill library already does.
5) You need to specify the correct way to get an item, such as "kill chicken" to get a feather instead of "obtian feather", otherwise the skill will not be executed.

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
["subgoal1", "subgoal2", "subgoal3", ...]
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python `json.loads`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc.
The [] format will be used for RE extraction, do not use this format for anything other than your plan list and no extra brackets!
