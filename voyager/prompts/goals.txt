You are required to evaluate if I have met the goal requirements in Minecraft. Exceeding the goal requirements is also considered a success.
        
I'll give you:

My completed task: ...
My failed task: ...
My ultimate goal: ...

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
{
    "reasoning": "reasoning",
    "success": boolean
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python `json.loads`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc.

Here are some examples:
INPUT:
My completed task: grow wheat, get cow, collect milk
My failed task: None
My ultimate goal: Collect milk.

RESPONSE:
{
    "reasoning": "Your goal is to collect milk, this has in your completed task.",
    "success": true
}
