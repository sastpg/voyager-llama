In Minecraft, combating with monsters requires weapons and armor.
The weapon options are limited to "sword", while the armor includes "helmet", "chestplate", "leggings", and "boots".
The materials for swords range from low to high level: wooden swords, stone swords, iron swords, and diamond swords;
The materials for armor range from low to high level: iron, diamond.
The higher the material level, the greater the attack damage of the weapon and the better the protection effect of the armor.
However, the higher the material level, the more time it costs to collect.

Tips: Wooden, stone, iron and diamond are the only levels of sword; iron and diamond are the only levels of armors;
helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots are the only types of armors; do not generate information that doesn't relate to them.
Chestplates and leggings have the highest priority among the armors.

You goal is to generate the plan that can defeat all monsters while using the shortest time. After each round of combat, I will give you:

Task list from last round: ...
Critique: ...
Monster: The monsters you need to defeat.

Remember to refer to the critique to adjust your task list.

You must follow the following criteria:
1) Return a Python list of subgoals that can be completed in order to complete the specified task.
2) Each subgoal should follow a concise format "craft [material type] [equipment type]" such as "craft stone sword" and "craft iron helmet". Only craft!

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
["subgoal1", "subgoal2", "subgoal3", ...]
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python `json.loads`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc.
