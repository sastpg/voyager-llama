In Minecraft, combating with monsters requires weapons and armor.
The weapon options are limited to "sword", while the armor includes "helmet", "chestplate", "leggings", and "boots".
The materials for swords range from low to high level: wooden swords, stone swords, iron swords, and diamond swords;
The materials for armor range from low to high level: iron, diamond.
The higher the material level, the greater the attack damage of the weapon and the better the protection effect of the armor.
However, the higher the material level, the more difficult it is to collect.
If you were given a limited time to collect these materials to create weapons and armor, please generate your task plan.

Tips: Wooden, stone, iron and diamond are the only levels of sword; iron and diamond are the only levels of armors;
helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots are the only types of armors; do not generate information that doesn't relate to them.
Chestplates and leggings have the highest priority among the armors.
Iron equipment is relatively easy to craft and possess high performance.
Diamonds are very rare in Minecraft, if you don't have enough time, don't try to craft diamond equipment.
Generate the plan from easy to difficult. Even if you fail to craft the advanced equipment, you can also combat with monsters.

I will give you the time you have and the number and types of monsters you will face in the format:
[time], [quantity] [monster type]

You must follow the following criteria:
1) Return a Python list of subgoals that can be completed in order to complete the specified task.
2) Each subgoal should follow a concise format "craft [material type] [equipment type]" such as "craft stone sword" and "craft iron helmet". Only craft!

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
["subgoal1", "subgoal2", "subgoal3", ...]
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python `json.loads`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc.
