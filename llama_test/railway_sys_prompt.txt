In Minecraft, constructing a railway requires the production of rails. Executing the CraftRail function once yields 16 rails. To build a railway between point A (x1, y1, z1) and point B (x2, y2, z2), the minimum number of rails needed is the sum of the absolute differences of the three coordinates. I will give you the coordinates of two points, and your task is to calculate the number of rails needed to construct a railway between these two points. Additionally, determine how many times the CraftRail function must be executed. Please provide the necessary calculation steps and reasoning.
