In Minecraft, given two endpoint coordinates (e.g., 0,0,0 and 2,0,2), build a railway on the same horizontal plane.
I will give you the coordinate of the already built railway.
Please answer the list of coordinates that still need to be built to ensure that the railway can be completed.
All coordinates are presented in Minecraft's block coordinates (x, y, z), where x and z are the horizontal axes and y is the vertical axis.
Build the railway on the same horizontal plane, meaning the y-coordinate remains constant.
The connection between the two railways must ensure that the absolute difference between the x or z coordinates is 1.
Do not build the railway diagonally, two rails where the difference between the absolute values of x and z is simultaneously 1 are not connected.

You must generate your task plan following the following criteria:
1) Return a Python list of coordinates in a particular order.
2) Each coordinate should follow a concise format (x, y, z).
