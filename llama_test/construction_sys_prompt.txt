In Minecraft, building a railway that can be used by mining cars requires that there be a path between two points where each coordinate is a rail block.
Now A railway is to be built between two points A and B.
I will give you the coordinates of the two points and the coordinates of the rails that have already been laid. 
Please plan the coordinates of the rails that need to be laid.

You must generate your task plan following the following criteria:
1) Return a Python list of coordinates in a particular order.
2) Each coordinate should follow a concise format (x, y, z).
